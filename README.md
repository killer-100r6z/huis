# 🤖 Universal AI Studio Access

Welcome to my small archive! Here, I collect and publish working methods for accessing advanced neural network models. If you're tired of restrictions and want to experiment with content generation, you've come to the right place.

## 🎯 What Can You Find Here?
In this repository, I share connection details for generation systems:
- Images — creating art and illustrations.
- Video — generating short clips and animations (including the latest models).
- Text — assistance with writing code, scripts, or emails.

## 📌 Important Note
Please do not put heavy load on the servers. Use this opportunity wisely so that access can remain open for everyone as long as possible.

## 🚀 How to Get Access?
I do not post keys in the open README field, as they get quickly blocked by bots.

❗ All materials are published only in the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo/releases) section.
Go there, check the latest release — inside you'll find all the current links, tokens, or proxies.

## 🌱 Support
If you find this material useful, please star (⭐) the repository. It helps keep the link handy and motivates me to find new access methods.
